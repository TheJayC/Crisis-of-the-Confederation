EVTDESCLOVERS0;You've been spending a lot of time in the company of [From.GetFullName] lately, and you're starting to think you might be developing romantic feelings for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTALOVERS4;I'm sorry, [From.GetFirstName]. It's over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTALOVERS6;I can live with that, I suppose.;Je suppose qu'il est temps de laisser [From.GetFirstName] partir.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLOVERS6;That traitor! I'll never forgive [From.GetHerHim]!;Quel traitre!Je n'oublierais jamais [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLOVERS6;This '[FromFrom.GetFirstName]' will pay for trying to steal my love!;Ce '[FromFrom.GetFirstName]' paiera pour m'avoir voler mon amour!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS8;You have a rival for [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s affections - [From.GetFullName], [FromFrom.GetHerHis] lover, confronted you in the corridor and demanded that you keep your hands away from [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALOVERS8;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] doesn't belong to you, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS9;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] was not happy about you trying to start up a new relationship.

EVTDESCLOVERS21;You had been enjoying the day, up until [From.GetFullName] burst into your chambers in a rage. 'Did you think I wouldn't notice?'

I love [FromFrom.GetHerHim], and [FromFrom.GetSheHe] loves me, and we'll do just fine without you!';Vous goûtier une agréable journée, jusqu'à ce qu' [From.GetFullName] déboule dans votre chambre comme une furie.

EVTOPTBLOVERS21;Perhaps I don't love [FromFrom.GetHerHim] that much after all.;Peu-être que je n'aime pas [From.GetHerHim] tant que ça.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS51;Can love bloom, even on the battlefield?

Perhaps now is the time to confess your love?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALOVERS51;Together, we can end this war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLOVERS51;This is the most absurd foolishness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLOVERS52;might return your feelings - or deal you with the same way as any other enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS52;There is a lull in the fighting in the [Root.Location.GetName] System. An enemy officer, [From.GetFullName], has requested a private meeting with you. Fearing a trap, but still curious, you agreed. When [From.GetSheHe] arrived, however, [From.GetSheHe] shocked you with [From.GetHerHis] confession - [From.GetSheHe] has fallen in love with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALOVERS52;I love you, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLOVERS52;Security? Seize [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLOVERS52;I'm afraid you've made a grave miscalculation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDLOVERS52;I don't... I can't... Get out. Now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLOVERS53;falls in love with [Root.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS53;You arranged a secretive rendezvous with [From.GetFirstName], to confess your love - and to your great joy, [From.GetSheHe] returns it! The two of you spent the night in each others' arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLOVERS54;is heartbroken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLOVERS55;is captured and made your prisoner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS55;You arranged a secretive rendezvous with [From.GetFirstName], to confess your love. Alas, it appears your heart has made a fool of you. No sooner do you come aboard [From.GetHerHis] ship then [From.GetSheHe] orders you restrained. It appears you are to be taken as a prisoner of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS56;Good news, today - it appears that a particularly foolish enemy officer, [FromFrom.GetFullName], fell for your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFullName]. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] soon learned that [From.GetFirstName] did not return [FromFrom.GetHerHis] affections, as [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has now been delivered into a prison cell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLOVERS57;dies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS53;You arranged a secretive rendezvous with [From.GetFirstName], to confess your love. Alas, it appears your heart has made a fool of you. No sooner do you come aboard [From.GetHerHis] ship then [From.GetSheHe] orders you restrained, and places a gun to your head. [From.GetHerHisCap] beautiful face is the last thing you ever see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS62;It has come to your attention that your [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetFullName], has been fraternizing with the enemy. [FromFrom.GetHerHisCap] illicit relationship with [From.GetFullName] could pose a serious security risk if vital information were to be leaked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALOVERS62;Get me a warrant for [FromFrom.GetHerHis] arrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLOVERS62;Who am I to stand in the way of love?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS63;There is a small problem. It appears that [From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName] has discovered your relationship with [FromFrom.GetFirstName], and [From.GetSheHe] does not approve. [From.GetSheHeCap] has already filed a warrant for your arrest on charges of fraternizing with the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCLOVERS65;You received a rather surprising gift in the mail today - a pre-emptive "wedding present" from [From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName] [From.GetHerHim]self! It appears that [From.GetSheHe] has discovered your illicit relationship with [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. Fortunately, it seems this little prank is nothing more than [From.GetHerHis] way of showing [From.GetHerHis] tacit approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCLOVERS70;This war is tearing you and your beloved apart. You can't believe the stubborn fool insists on supporting such an unworthy cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALOVERS70;Surely, love can show them the light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLOVERS70;We'll have to agree to disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLOVERS71;must choose between you and [This.Liege.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS71;The war has driven a deep wedge between you and {From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] insists that [Root.Liege.GetTitle] [Root.Liege.GetFullName] must be stopped, at any cost, and desperately needs you to see [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] in the same light [From.GetSheHe] does.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS72;You and [From.GetFirstName] had a little chat, and it appears that [From.GetSheHe] is now at least slightly more willing to see why [From.Liege.GetFullName] must be defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS73;You and [From.GetFirstName] had a little chat. Unfortunately, the stubborn fool is too deeply stuck in [From.GetHerHis] wicked ways to see the truth. You are beginning to wonder what it was you ever saw in [From.GetHerHim] to begin with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLOVERS70;We'll have to agree to disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lovers_peace_decision;Make Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lovers_peace_decision_desc;The love between you and [This.GetFirstName] shines brighter than the suns. Surely it can bring an end to this pointless war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLOVERS80;will ask [Root.GetFullName] to make peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS81;TO: Dearest [Root.GetFirstName]\nFROM: [From.GetFirstName]\nRE: The War\nWhat is the point of this bloody conflict? Countless billions are dying, and for what? Surely, the power of our love is great enough to put an end to it and bring peace?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS82;TO: Dearest [Root.GetFirstName]\nFROM: [From.GetFirstName]\nRE: The War\nYou are right, of course. The bloodshed must end. The [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] hereby agrees to a ceasefire with the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS83;TO: Dearest [Root.GetFirstName]\nFROM: [From.GetFirstName]\nRE: The War\nI am sorry, but this is bigger than the two of us. What we are doing is right, and I will not allow my emotions to stand in the way of the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMARRIAGE1;You are older now, and you are putting the naivety of youth behind you. Love and romance are luxuries of those who do not hold the reigns of power. Marriage is a political tool, and you have a duty to use it for the betterment of yourself and the people under your protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAMARRIAGE1;It's time to start looking for a political marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARRIAGE52;The [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] family have held control over your company since its foundation, but now the future of that family name is in jeopardy. At present, almost none of your relatives are in a position where they can further the family name. Fortunately, your [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetName], is one of those few. As [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is young and umarried, perhaps you could arrange a political marriage with one of your employees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAMARRIAGE52;Family is the only thing that matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBMARRIAGE52;The situation isn't that bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARRIAGE100;You are considering proposing to your lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAMARRIAGE100;Will you marry me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPMARRIAGE101;will be asked to marry you. §YThis will be a same-sex marriage. You will not be able to produce biological children.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARRIAGE101;Your lover [From.GetFirstName] has taken you out on the date of a lifetime. An outing to the latest holofilm, a long walk through a beautiful garden, and finally dinner at the most expensive restaurant in town. It's here, finally, that [From.GetSheHe] opens up a small box, and reveals a narrow golden ring. '[Root.GetFirstName],' [From.GetSheHe] says, 'will you marry me?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAMARRIAGE101;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBMARRIAGE101;...I'm sorry, [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMARRIAGE105;Treachery! The love of your life, [From.GetFullName], has married another!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAMARRIAGE105;Damn them both to the blackest pits of hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBMARRIAGE105;How could [From.GetSheHe], that traitor?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCMARRIAGE105;[FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName], [From.GetFirstName] is mine and mine alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDMARRIAGE105;Perhaps it would be best just to let it go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPMARRIAGE102;will marry you. §YThis will be a same-sex marriage. You will not be able to produce biological children.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPMARRIAGE201;will be asked to marry you. §YThis will be a patrilineal marriage. All biological children will be of your dynasty.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPMARRIAGE312;will marry you. §YThis will be a patrilineal marriage. All biological children will be of your dynasty.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS201;You've been feeling awfully lonely tonight. Perhaps it's time you went and paid [From.GetFirstName] a visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLOVERS201;considers spending a night of passion in your arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALOVERS201;I'll give [From.GetHerHim] a good tumble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLOVERS201;I don't think [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] would approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCLOVERS201;I don't want that kind of trouble with [From.Spouse.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDLOVERS201;Nah, my favorite show is on holo tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS202;Your lover, [From.GetFullName], has asked to spend a night of passionate lovemaking in your arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS203;The two of you made wild and passionate love all night. Truly, it was a remarkable evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS204;[From.GetFirstName] spurned your advances! [From.GetSheHeCapital] insisted that the two of you could not afford the scandal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS205;[From.GetFirstName] spurned your advances! [From.GetSheHeCapital] said [From.GetSheHe] had better things to do with [From.GetHerHis] time. Unbelievable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLOVERS301;You have been drifting further and further from [From.GetFirstName]. Do you even still love [From.GetHerHim] anymore?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALOVERS301;It's time to move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLOVERS301;I'll have to make it work somehow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBASTARD102;Your new [GetFromRelation] has finally been born! Unfortunately, it appears that your plan to pass [From.GetHerHim] off as [From.Father.GetFirstName]'s child may have hit a small snag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABASTARD102;...maybe it's recessive?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBASTARD103;Your new [GetFromRelation] has finally been born! Unfortunately, it appears that [From.Mother.GetFirstName]'s plan to pass [From.GetHerHim] off as [From.Father.GetFirstName]'s child may have hit a small snag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBASTARD104;You were overjoyed to learn that your wife had just given birth to a new [GetFromRelation]. You were less overjoyed when you finally got a good look at [From.GetHerHim]. Somebody has a LOT of explaining to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBASTARD110;Your indiscretions are apparently coming back to get you, as your recent affair has result in a child, young [From.GetFirstName]. It is up to you to decide [From.GetHerHis] fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABASTARD110;Legitimize [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBBASTARD110;Denounce [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBASTARD111;Denounce [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBASTARD150;There's been a bit of a scandal in the [Root.Location.GetName] System. It appears that [From.Mother.GetFullName] and [From.Father.GetFullName] have produced a slight... indiscretion. As [Root.GetTitle], you are responsible for determing little [From.GetFirstName]'s fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBASTARD151;will adopt [From.GetFirstName] into [This.GetHerHis] dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBASTARD151;After careful consideration, the [From.GetTitle] has determined that [FromFrom.GetFirstName] should be held responsible for the crimes of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] parents. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] is to be regarded as a legitimate child of your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBASTARD152;will be pleased that [From.GetFirstName] is legitimate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBASTARD152;After careful consideration, the [From.GetTitle] has determined that [FromFrom.GetFirstName] should be held responsible for the crimes of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] parents. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] is to be regarded as a legitimately-born child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBASTARD153;isn't going to be happy about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBASTARD153;It would appear your spouse has not been entirely honest with you, as little [FromFrom.GetFirstName] can attest. Not only do you now have to face the fact of your spouse's infidelity, but you are required to treat the child as if [FromFrom.GetSheHe] were of legitimate birth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBASTARD155;won't be angry at you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABASTARD155;This is outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBBASTARD155;Eh, I'll live.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

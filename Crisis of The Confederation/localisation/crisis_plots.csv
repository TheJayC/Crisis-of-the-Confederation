Your nostrils fill with the acrid scent of smoke.\n\nThe world goes dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION430;Gryaaah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION431;You focus hard on your hand. It's YOUR hand. This should not be difficult. The presence resists, but only for a moment. Whatever it was, it was not expecting you. For a moment, you almost think you can hear a faint cry of pain, before all is well again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION431;What was THAT all about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION432;While you never received word back from [From.GetFullName], a mutual friend eventually contacted you, informing you that [From.GetHerHis] efforts to hack [Root.PlotTarget.GetFullName]'s DNI were a dismal failure, and that [From.GetHerHis] own DNI suffered severe physical damage in the attempt. [From.GetSheHeCap] has been hospitalized in critical condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION450;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetFullName]\nRE: [From.PlotTarget.GetFullName]\n[From.PlotTarget.GetFullName] believes that [From.GetSheHe] is safe, but [From.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] has left us a backdoor into [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] own mind - a Direct Neural Interface. I want you to hack [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] DNI and force [From.PlotTarget.GerHerHim] to commit suicide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION455;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetFullName]\nRE: [Root.PlotTarget.GetFullName]\nI'm sorry, but this is simply too dangerous. My part in this scheme is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION500;Sometimes the simplest approach is the best one. You already know the details of [Root.PlotTarget.GetFullName]'s security arrangements. You already have people in position. Why bother with the middleman when you could just shoot [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION500;I'll deal with [Root.GetHerHim] myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBASSASSINATION500;I have an agent in place who can handle this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCASSASSINATION500;No, the direct approach is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCASSASSINATION510;You are in your quarters, about to turn in for the night, when you hear sounds of a struggle outside your door. Before you can react, the door opens, and one of your guards falls to the floor, lifeless. A blood-soaked figure stands silhouetted in the door frame, with a pistol trained carefully on your heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION510;You'll never get away with this, [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBASSASSINATION510;Who's there?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCSSASSINATION511;Armed with the knowledge you possess, you easily cut your way through [From.GetFullName]'s security detail, slowly but steadily closing in on [From.GetHerHis] quarters. A few security guards manage to escape with their lives, but they cannot stop you from breaching their lines, until finally you stand silhouetted in [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s door frame, a pistol in your hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCASSASSINATION520;You are in your quarters, about to turn in for the night, when you hear sounds of a struggle outside your door. Before you can react, the door bursts open, and a figure crosses the threshold, a pistol in [From.GetHerHis] hand, firing wildly into the room. [From.GetSheHeCap] is forced to turn and flee, however, as gunfire rings out in the corridor, and your security detail comes charging down the hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION520;Was that [From.GetFullName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBASSASSINATION520;Who WAS that?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION521;The plan seemed perfect on paper. Disable the security grid, enter at night, shoot the perimeter guards before closing on [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s quarters. And it went well, at first. But by the time you found yourself in [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s door frame, the guards were already in hot pursuit. You only had time for a few wild shots before you were forced to run. And then, of course, you had the misfortune of running straight into the security office...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

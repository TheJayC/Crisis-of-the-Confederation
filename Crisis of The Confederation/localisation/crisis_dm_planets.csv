ca_planet_basic_penalties_desc;You should not be see this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_planet_r000;Dense Dust Ball;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_planet_r000_desc;A world that's pretty much the sum of all the worst aspects to put a military base on.  Resources are rare and to make matters worse, the gravity is very intense making launching spacecraft very expensive.  That said, it's better than putting an economic or scientific center here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_planet_r111;Haze World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_planet_r111_desc;This super terrestrial world has a large hazy atmosphere of hydrogen, methane, and helium.  It has a number of useful resources in it, but most are hidden below the surface.  Its large size also gives it fairly strong gravity as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_planet_r222;Dead Planet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_planet_r222_desc;This world once harbored a significant amount of life, but some kind of disaster has torn it apart, or the planet became uninhabitable thanks to other reasons.  While there is minor scientific value to be found here, it's mostly been stripped away.  The otherwise barren world makes a very good site for a military base, it has good access to volatiles and metals while also being fairly easy to launch off of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_planet_r333;War Station;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_planet_r333_desc;Built nearby a large planetary ring, a rich debris field, or a massive collection of captured Lagrange asteroids, this military outpost is in a prime location. It has easy access to any resources it might need as well as the advantage of being in space, making launching any craft considerably cheaper and easier than surface bases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start0_level0;Volatiles Level 0;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start0_level0_desc;This area has access to little if any water or low density gases.  Without significant infrastructure improvements and investments, any military base here will be severely limited in size and power due to the need to rely on outside support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start0_level1;Volatiles Level 1;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start0_level1_desc;Advanced recycling techniques have made things much easier on this base.  It can grow beyond rudimentary size, but is still limited by the need to import volatiles to use as fuel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start0_level2;Volatiles Level 2;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start0_level2_desc;Nuclear fission and fusion has been implemented to fabricate the necessary Oxygen, Nitrogen, and other volatiles using other elements available in abundance.  The process isn't exactly efficient energy wise, preventing this base from reaching maximum size.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start0_level3;Volatiles Level 3;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start0_level3_desc;A Prometheus Nexus has been constructed here, allowing the creation of plasma fuel.  This replaces the use of volatiles altogether in power generation and propulsion.  Even the most barren of rocks can support massive human military bases with one of these.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start1_level1;Volatiles Level 1;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start1_level1_desc;Small amounts of water, ice, and other light gases are easily accessible in this location, but the size of any outpost or settlement here will be limited unless new sources are found or better consumption systems are developed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start1_level2;Volatiles Level 2;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start1_level2_desc;Improved mining and recycling technologies have been implemented here, greatly lessening the stress on the natural resources here.  The base is fully capable of reaching nearly maximum size now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start1_level3;Volatiles Level 3;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start1_level3_desc;With fusion and fission reactors now deployed here, the base no longer has any difficulties getting all the resources it needs to grow to full size.  While the process isn't exactly energy efficient, it isn't needed often enough to limit expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start2_level2;Volatiles Level 2;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start2_level2_desc;Lakes or significant amounts of frozen ice are available here in addition to light gasses that can be harvested from the atmosphere.  Anything short of a massive military works can be easily supported by the natural resources available.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start2_level3;Volatiles Level 3;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start2_level3_desc;Thanks to the addition of several recycling plants and water treatment facilities, this military base is no longer limited in growth by its access to volatiles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start3_level3;Volatiles Level 3;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_volatiles_start3_level3_desc;Abundant volatiles are available on this planet in either frozen or gaseous form.  No special facilities or techniques are needed to harvest them and access to volatiles will not in any way limit this facility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ct_planet_basic_penalties_desc;You should not be see this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_planet_r000;Barren Rock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_planet_r000_desc;This planet is almost worthless to humans, save that it's rocks can be turned into soil for growing crops.  It has no atmosphere, very few volatiles, no unusual or useful materials, or good sites for launching ships from.  It's just a barren rock of a world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_planet_r111;Frozen Desert;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_planet_r111_desc;This cool planet orbits too far away from its star to have liquid water on the surface, but there are sufficiently large quantities of frozen water and carbon in its rocks that a reasonably sized economic outpost could be established on the planet.  The planet has all of what humans need to make economic goods, though not in great amounts without significant terraforming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_planet_r222;Rim World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_planet_r222_desc;This planet is in the habitable zone, but it is tidally locked to its parent star.  This means that one side is permanently bathed in sunlight, and the other permanently dark.  It's atmosphere gives it a constant flow of wind from the cold side to the hot side near the surface, while another current wraps around the world in the other direction at the upper levels of the atmosphere.  Only a thin ring of the planet's surface near the terminal between night and day is habitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_planet_r333;Earth-Like;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_planet_r333_desc;This planet is ideal for human habitation, since it's features are incredibly similar to the homeworld.  It has liquid oceans, a breathable atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen, and continents to grow crops in and build cities.  These perfect planets are highly sought after in Terran space, and controlling one can give a huge edge thanks to their incredible economic potential with little to no required terraforming investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_volatiles_start0_level0;Volatiles Level 0;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_volatiles_start0_level0_desc;This area has access to little if any water or low density gases.  Without significant infrastructure improvements and investments, any settlement or economic development here will be severely limited in size and power due to the need to rely on outside support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_volatiles_start0_level1;Volatiles Level 1;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ct_volatiles_start0_level2;Volatiles Level 2;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_volatiles_start0_level2_desc;Nuclear fission and fusion has been implemented to fabricate the necessary Oxygen, Nitrogen, and other volatiles using other elements available in abundance.  The process isn't exactly efficient energy wise, limiting the settlement's size to only one major city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_volatiles_start0_level3;Volatiles Level 3;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_volatiles_start0_level3_desc;A Prometheus Nexus has been constructed here, allowing the creation of plasma fuel.  This replaces the use of volatiles altogether in power generation. With the huge amounts of energy now available to the population, they can fabricate all the nutrients and materials the population and its agriculture sectors could need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tp_planet_basic_penalties_desc;You should not be see this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_planet_r000;Rare Core;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_planet_r000_desc;The properties of this planet's core are very unusual and are sufficient grounds to build a scientific outpost on to study, after all other nearby options are exhausted.  The planet is very poor overall, and a lot of infrastructure and work will have to be invested before it can grow to any appreciable size.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_planet_r111;Ruin World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_planet_r111_desc;Sometime in the geologically recent past, this planet suffered a huge catastrophe that greatly altered and reshaped it's surface.  The planet did once harbor life, but anything that was larger than single celled organism died in the disaster.  On some of these planets, not even the microbes lived.  This station studies the life that once lived on the planet, piecing together the story and nature of the lost organisms.  While the surface is in really rough shape, the planet still sits in the habitable zone, making things a bit easier on the scientists who call it home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_planet_r222;Temperate Primitive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_planet_r222_desc;This planet is in the early stages of its lifecycle.  Life has only recently started to take hold here, growing as tiny single celled organisms, growing their own form of genetics and developing cell structures that will form the basis of later life on this planet.  This station exists to study this primordial world and its emerging biosphere, entirely different from Earth's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_planet_r333;Wonder World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_planet_r333_desc;This planet is truly wonderous.  There are a multitude of amazing things to study on it that might range from complex multi-cellular life, to incredible rare compounds, to incredible natural processes that would take centuries to fully understand.  To make matters even better, the planet's conditions are nearly perfect for humans to work on and build on.  The only problem is that these planets tend to be hot targets for any would be warlord to use as their personal mad science lab.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
